# Bone-fracture-Classification
  In this study, an effort is made to automate the classification of six specific type is obtaineds of bone fractures using deep learning techniques. An accuracy of 86% by using non-local means filtering, wavelet-based denoising, and DenseNet both for model training and transfer learning.
